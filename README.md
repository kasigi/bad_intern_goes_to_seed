# The Bad Intern Goes to Yolo

The international Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburg... concern has hired our agency to build a concept design for their new seed store. It's still a prototype and has only been lightly styled.

Once again, the new intern has been asked to work on the project and they are unable to make the project work. The client is furious and the sales team is placating with cheese pastries. The supply will last for 60 minutes (they planned ahead this time).

The Client's Complaints with no coffee!:
* There are numerous errors overall that prevent the site from running
* None of the routers work
* The wrong content is showing on the homepage! It should be the wheat background image and the "Going to Seed... and then letting it grow" tagline
* The wheat image seems to have been left out and a yellow placeholder is being used instead. Get the wheat back.
* The /products link in the navigation doesn't work at all
* The top of the product block is showing the country it came from and not the seed type.
* The image alt attribute doesn't appear to render. Some of the buyers are government-based and require full support for the blind.
* The product block header is bright pink!!!  It should be rgb(44,40,40);
* The button is supposed to disable if the inventory is 0. It doesn't appear to be working
* The forms all have the same ID - this is not valid and screen readers will complain.
* The number of products shown should reduce as the screen gets smaller. At the largest size it should be 4-across, and at the smallest (mobile size 1-across)
